        <h2>Industrial Products</h2>
        <p>Businesses usually purchase an industrial product to make other products or to help them with running their business. An item that would be a consumer product if a customer bought it, such as cleaning supplies, may become an industrial product if a business buys it.</p>
        <p>There are several types of industrial products:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Capital goods</li>
            <li>Raw materials</li>
            <li>Component parts</li>
            <li>Major equipment</li>
            <li>Accessory equipment</li>
            <li>Operating supplies</li>
        </ul>

                    Industrial products refer to those products that are used as inputs for the production of other goods.<br> Such goods are not meant for final consumption rather they are used as raw material and inputs by the manufacturers <br> for the production of consumer goods. For example, machines, tools etc. are industrial products.

        <h2>Service Products</h2>
        <p>Service products are business offerings that are either a pure service or a core service. A pure service is a service without a tangible result, such as education, while a core service has a tangible result, like cleaning services. Some product categorizations place service products under industry products, but they can be their own type of product because many are available to consumers directly.</p>

            Many services are difficult to understand and communicate, and as a result, difficult to position, differentiate, and sell.<br> While important, understanding services as well-defined products has hardly received research attention although doing so offers a <br> host of potential benefits. This conceptual article makes the following contributions. First, it synthesizes the literature to <br> develop a better understanding of service productization as a process that transforms variable, ad-hoc services and service <br>products into well-defined service products (i.e., ‘productized services’).
